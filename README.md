# hello-world

What I would like to accomplish in Web Design:
I would like to become a proficient front-end programmer.
I have minimal training in html and css but none in javascript.
With this program, I would like to expand on and master these languages
and become a great web developer/designer.  It's a long road ahead 
but I am excited to get started with it.
Thank you
